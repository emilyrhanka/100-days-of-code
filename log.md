# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Git and Git Bash, and made my first Git Commit!

**Thoughts:** I've been meaning to learn more about Github and Git, but I'd never taken the time to figure out how they work or why they're important as a developer. This is the first step in my quest to share my coding journey. First Github - next, the world!
